This code is a meshsmooth method based on spatial interpolation. It has a parameter to control the smoothness of the results. You can choose between keeping a number on vertices untouched and the program will try to find a smooth surface between these vertices and the smoothed ones.
The speed of the code have to be improved.
Mesh partitioning and parallel process is under development.
